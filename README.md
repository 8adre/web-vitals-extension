# Web Vitals Chrome Extension

[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/metrics) is an effort to measure the quality and performance of user-experiences on the web. 

To assist developers in their iteration workflows towards hitting the Core Web Vitals metric thresholds, this Chrome extension visualizes the metric values (LCP, FID, CLS) and whether they fall into good/adequate/poor buckets.

## Use cases

* I'm a developer browsing the web. I would like to quickly check how well a URL performs on the Core Web Vitals. 
* I'm a developer actively building a page. I would like to see how metrics improve as I make local changes.
